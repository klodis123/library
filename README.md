Library Management System

This is a simple Library Management System built with Java and Hibernate to demonstrate my skills in Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and database integration.


Technologies Used:

Java

Hibernate (JPA)

MySQL (or your preferred relational database)

Maven for project management and dependencies


Features:

Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing books and users

Database schema management using Hibernate annotations

Basic validation and error handling


Getting Started:

Clone this repository to your local machine

Configure the database connection in the hibernate.cfg.xml file

Use Maven to build the project

Run the application


Usage:

This application allows you to manage library books and users through CRUD operations.

You can extend it by adding a REST API or a user interface in the future.
